# Part 2 - Isolation by Distance and Fine-scale Spatial Genetic Structure

This suit of scripts were developed based on [LanGen_pipeline](https://github.com/rojaff/LanGen_pipeline)

For a similar pipeline without using *VCFtools v.0.1.16*, check our [Populational Genomics Pipeline](https://github.com/jdalapicolla/PopGenPipe)

&nbsp;

## Scripts:

__2.1_MANTEL_TESTS.R__: Mantel tests for classical Isolation by Distance (IBD) tests

__2.2_PROCRUSTES.R2__: Procrustes Analyses - Association between Geography and Genetics matrices

__2.3_LOESS.R__: LOESS model to indicate where individuals are more related to each other in the study area than the expected by chance

__2.4_sPCA.R__: Spatial PCA - Compare allelic frequency of individuals to their neighbours and plot it in a map

__2.5_EEMS.R___: EEMS - Spatial population structure with EEMS - Estimated Effective Migration Surface
